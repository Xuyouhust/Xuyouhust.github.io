# ‚õ™About me
Hello, my name is You Xu. I'm a final-year Ph.D. candidate in the Sixth Generation Mobile Communication (6G) Research Center of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. I work on millimeter-wave non-line-of-sight sensing algorithms under different relay surfaces, especially using electromagnetic features of these relay surfaces to enhance the target contour reconstruction capability in the non-line-of-sight region.

I am fortunate to be advised by IEEE Fellow Prof. [Tao Jiang](http://sinc-lab.cse.hust.edu.cn/info/1014/1024.htm). I was a Visiting Student Researcher at the University of Macau, where I worked with Prof. [Shaodan Ma](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/personal/shaodanma/) in [The State Key Laboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City ](https://skliotsc.um.edu.mo/). I received my master's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2021. 

My research interest includes mmWave Sensing, sparse signal processing and NLOS imaging. I have published 10+ papers at the IEEE conferences/journals such as TSP, IOTJ, SPL, PIMRC.  

I am on the job market for postdoc and industry research scientist positions. Please reach out if you are interested in my research! Here is my Research Statement. 
 
# üñ•Ô∏èResearch Statement
------
My research goal is to leverage environmental information and millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar sensing to reconstruct non-line-of-sight (NLOS) target features in dark, complex underground environments such as mines and tunnels. To achieve this, I am investigating mmWave sparse signal reconstruction and electromagnetic imaging techniques for hidden target detection. Specifically, I focus on extracting high-fidelity target characteristics from multipath echoes, enabling UAVs, robots, or autonomous vehicles to perceive and navigate through occluded and geometrically uncertain spaces:
- **Analysis and Design of Relay Surface Characteristics**: Investigate the scattering properties of three key types of rough relay surfaces \| Design optimized relay surfaces
- **Multipath Signal Processing and Sparse Reconstruction**: mmWave imaging resolution using compressed sensing and Bayesian \| Develop advanced signal separation techniques to isolate true target signatures.
- **Adaptive NLOS Sensing System Development**: Design a reconfigurable mmWave radar system capable of dynamically adjusting beamforming and signal processing based on relay surface properties.
- **Experimental Validation in Real-World Scenarios**: Conduct lab-scale experiments using controlled rough surfaces to validate signal models\| Deploy and test the system in realistic underground environments.
