Hello, my name is You Xu. I'm a final-year Ph.D. candidate in the Sixth Generation Mobile Communication (6G) Research Center of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. I work on millimeter-wave non-line-of-sight sensing algorithms under different relay surfaces, especially using electromagnetic features of these relay surfaces to enhance the target contour reconstruction capability in the non-line-of-sight region.

I am fortunate to be advised by IEEE Fellow Prof. [Tao Jiang](http://sinc-lab.cse.hust.edu.cn/info/1014/1024.htm). I was a Visiting Student Researcher at the University of Macau, where I worked with Prof. [Shaodan Ma](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/personal/shaodanma/) in [The State Key Laboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City ](https://skliotsc.um.edu.mo/). I received my master's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2021. 

My research interest includes speech synthesis, neural machine translation and automatic music generation. I have published 50+ papers  at the top international AI conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, KDD.  

I am on the job market for postdoc and industry research scientist positions. Please reach out if you are interested in my research! Here is my Research Statement.
