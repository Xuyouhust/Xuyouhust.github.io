# About me
Hello, my name is You Xu. I'm a final-year Ph.D. candidate in the Sixth Generation Mobile Communication (6G) Research Center of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. I work on millimeter-wave non-line-of-sight sensing algorithms under different relay surfaces, especially using electromagnetic features of these relay surfaces to enhance the target contour reconstruction capability in the non-line-of-sight region.

I am fortunate to be advised by IEEE Fellow Prof. [Tao Jiang](http://sinc-lab.cse.hust.edu.cn/info/1014/1024.htm). I was a Visiting Student Researcher at the University of Macau, where I worked with Prof. [Shaodan Ma](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/personal/shaodanma/) in [The State Key Laboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City ](https://skliotsc.um.edu.mo/). I received my master's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2021. 

My research interest includes speech synthesis, neural machine translation and automatic music generation. I have published 50+ papers  at the top international AI conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, KDD.  

I am on the job market for postdoc and industry research scientist positions. Please reach out if you are interested in my research! Here is my Research Statement.

My research goal is to ground logical goals and sensory information in robot skills. To achieve this, I study planning for robot manipulation with learned relational dynamics. Specifically, I focus on learning to predict relational dynamics from partial-view point clouds, which enables the robot to solve challenging real-world tasks including:
- Planning to logical goals with manipulating multiple dynamically interacting objects (RD-GNN).
- Reasoning about how the manipulated objects interact with the structural elements of the environment (eRDTransformer).
- Leveraging objects-oriented memory with a video tracker to reason about occluded objects (DOOM and LOOM).
- Solving long-horizon manipulation tasks with a composable planning framework (Points2Plans).
- Detecting failure cases, recovering from them, and improving the dynamics model using these cases (Fail2Progress).
